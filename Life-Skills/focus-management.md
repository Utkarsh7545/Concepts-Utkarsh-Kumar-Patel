### Getting Started on Difficult Tasks

To overcome procrastination, focus on breaking the task into small steps:

2.  Take a short break.
3.  Affirm that you are capable of completing the task, whether it's scary or boring.

By repeating this process and gradually increasing the work time, you build confidence and reduce resistance to the task. This method helps create evidence of your ability, making the task feel less daunting over time.
