    **Question 2**: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?  
    _**Solution**_: B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To form a new habit:
    
    -   **Motivation (M)**: Your desire to perform the behavior.
    -   **Ability (A)**: The ease of executing the behavior.
    -   **Prompt (P)**: A trigger to remind you to act.  
        You can make habits easier by increasing ability (e.g., making the action simpler) and ensuring effective prompts are in place.
    
    **Question 3**: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?  
    _**Solution**_: Celebrating or "Shining" after completing a habit reinforces positive behavior by associating it with success. This emotional reinforcement helps solidify the habit, making it more likely to persist.

4.  **Book Summary of Atomic Habits**  
    **Question 5**: What is the book's perspective about Identity?  
    _**Solution**_: The book posits that true behavior change starts with altering your identity, not just your actions. It encourages focusing on becoming the type of person who engages in desired behaviors (e.g., identifying as "a healthy person" rather than simply wanting to lose weight).
    
    **Question 6**: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.  
    _**Solution**_: To make a habit easier, the book suggests reducing friction. This can be achieved by simplifying the process or environment, such as laying out workout clothes in advance to encourage exercising.
    
    **Question 7**: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.  
    _**Solution**_: To break a bad habit, the book advises increasing friction or barriers to that behavior. For example, keeping unhealthy snacks out of the house makes it harder to indulge in junk food.
    
5.  **Reflection**  
    **Question 8**: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious, or the habit more attractive or easy, and/or the response satisfying?  
    _**Solution**_: If you want to read more, make the cue obvious by placing books in visible areas. To make it attractive, choose genres you enjoy, and enhance satisfaction by rewarding yourself after finishing a chapter.
    
    **Question 9**: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible, or the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?  
    _**Solution**_: To reduce social media use, make the cue invisible by turning off notifications or deleting apps from your home screen. Reflect on the time wasted to make the process unattractive, and set limits on usage to make the response unsatisfying.
