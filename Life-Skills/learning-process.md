-   **Active (Focused) Mode**: Concentrated effort on a task, using working memory to solve problems.
-   **Diffused Mode**: Relaxed, free-flowing thinking, where the brain unconsciously makes connections and solves problems without focused attention.

-   **Explain concepts in your own words**: Practice the Feynman Technique to deeply understand and explain software concepts.
-   **Implement what you learn**: Apply concepts in code or design to solidify your understanding.
-   **Set and adhere to deadlines**: Use deadlines to allocate time to topics, focusing on concepts and making the learning process enjoyable.
