# Good Practices for Software Development

**Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?**

-   The suggestion to write down all questions and send them as a single message instead of bombarding someone with multiple messages stood out as a new strategy for me. While I'm used to sending messages as they come up, organizing thoughts into one clear message before sending can help avoid overwhelming others and streamline the response process.
    
-   The emphasis on always over-communicating, especially in situations like changing deadlines or technical issues, was also a good reminder. Iâ€™ve generally been reactive in communication, but proactive communication could prevent potential issues before they escalate.
    

**Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

One area I need to improve is managing distractions during work, particularly around social media usage and maintaining sustained focus. Some ideas for progress include:

-   Using tools like TimeLimit or Freedom to block distracting websites during work hours.
-   Tracking my time more diligently using a productivity app like Boosted to identify patterns where I lose focus and improve them.
-   Applying more principles of deep work to create structured blocks of focused, uninterrupted work sessions.
